Guess My Number!" is a fun and interactive game built with vanilla JavaScript that runs in the browser. It's a simple yet captivating guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20.

How to Play
The game starts with a randomly generated secret number that the player needs to guess.
The player enters their guess into an input field and clicks the 'Check!' button to submit their guess.
If the guess is too high or too low, the game will give a hint to help the player adjust their next guess.
The player's score decreases by 1 with each incorrect guess. The goal is to guess the number with as few attempts as possible.
If the player guesses the correct number, the game displays a winning message, and the background color changes to celebrate the victory.
The player can attempt to beat their high score in subsequent rounds.
